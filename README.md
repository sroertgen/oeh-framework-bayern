# OEH-Framework-Bayern

For a PoC the school curriculums data of Bavaria were crawled using the script `crawl_bavaria`.

This project is trying to convert it into machine-readable format and make it available on the web regarding to semantic web standards.

## Crawling

- TODO provide description

## Schema

The model for providing the data is described using [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/).

Some inspiration was coming from the [K12OCX project](https://k12ocx.github.io/k12ocx-specs/). 

- TODO elaborate
